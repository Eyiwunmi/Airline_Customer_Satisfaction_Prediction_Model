This study analyzes airline customer satisfaction using predictive modeling based on key service and operational factors. 
The parameters considered include Departure Delay (punctuality of flights), Leg Room Service (spaciousness and comfort of seating arrangements), 
Cleanliness (hygiene and upkeep of the aircraft), and Seat Comfort (overall passenger comfort while seated). 
These features were used to predict overall customer satisfaction levels,
providing insights into the aspects of airline service that most strongly influence passengerÂ experience.
